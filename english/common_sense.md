# Common sense

Common sense reasoning tasks are intended to require the model to go beyond pattern 
recognition. Instead, the model should use "common sense" or world knowledge
to make inferences.

### Event2Mind

Event2Mind is a crowdsourced corpus of 25,000 event phrases covering a diverse range of everyday events and situations.
Given an event described in a short free-form text, a model should reason about the likely intents and reactions of the
event's participants. Models are evaluated based on average cross-entropy (lower is better).

### SWAG

Situations with Adversarial Generations (SWAG) is a dataset consisting of 113k multiple
choice questions about a rich spectrum of grounded situations.

### Winograd Schema Challenge

The [Winograd Schema Challenge](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/KR/KR12/paper/view/4492)
is a dataset for common sense reasoning. It employs Winograd Schema questions that
require the resolution of anaphora: the system must identify the antecedent of an ambiguous pronoun in a statement. Models
are evaluated based on accuracy.

Example:

The trophy doesnâ€™t fit in the suitcase because _it_ is too big. What is too big?
Answer 0: the trophy. Answer 1: the suitcase

### Visual Common Sense

Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) is a new task and large-scale dataset for cognition-level visual understanding.
With one glance at an image, we can effortlessly imagine the world beyond the pixels (e.g. that [person1] ordered 
pancakes). While this task is easy for humans, it is tremendously difficult for today's vision systems, requiring 
higher-order cognition and commonsense reasoning about the world. We formalize this task as Visual Commonsense 
Reasoning. In addition to answering challenging visual questions expressed in natural language, a model must provide a 
rationale explaining why its answer is true.
