# Grammatical Error Correction

Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) is the task of correcting different kinds of errors in text such as spelling, punctuation, grammatical, and word choice errors. 

GEC is typically formulated as a sentence correction task. A GEC system takes a potentially erroneous sentence as input and is expected to transform it to its corrected version. See the example given below: 

| Input (Erroneous)          | Output (Corrected)     |
| -------------------------  | ---------------------- |
|She see Tom is catched by policeman in park at last night. | She saw Tom caught by a policeman in the park last night.|

### CoNLL-2014 Shared Task

The [CoNLL-2014 shared task test set](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~nlp/conll14st/conll14st-test-data.tar.gz) is the most widely used dataset to benchmark GEC systems. The test set contains 1,312 English sentences with error annotations by 2 expert annotators. Models are evaluated with MaxMatch scorer ([Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N12-1067)) which computes a span-based F<sub>β</sub>-score (β set to 0.5 to weight precision twice as recall).

The shared task setting restricts that systems use only publicly available datasets for training to ensure a fair comparison between systems. The highest published scores on the the CoNLL-2014 test set are given below. A distinction is made between papers that report results in the restricted CoNLL-2014 shared task setting of training using publicly-available training datasets only (_**Restricted**_) and those that made use of large, non-public datasets (_**Unrestricted**_).
