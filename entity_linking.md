# Entity Linking

## Task

Entity Linking (EL) is the task of recognizing (cf. [Named Entity Recognition](named_entity_recognition.md)) and disambiguating (Named Entity Disambiguation) named entities to a knowledge base (e.g. Wikidata, DBpedia, or YAGO). It is sometimes also simply known as Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation.

EL can be split into two classes of approaches:
* *End-to-End*: processing a piece of text to extract the entities (i.e. Named Entity Recognition) and then disambiguate these extracted entities to the correct entry in a given knowledge base (e.g. Wikidata, DBpedia, YAGO).
* *Disambiguation-Only*: contrary to the first approach, this one directly takes the annotated entities as input and then has just to disambiguate them to the correct entry in a given knowledge base.

Example:

| Barack | Obama | was | born | in | Hawaï |
| --- | ---| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama | O | O | O | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii |

More in details can be found in this [survey](http://dbgroup.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/wangjy/papers/TKDE14-entitylinking.pdf).

## Evaluation

### Metrics for Disambiguation-Only Approach

* Micro-Precision: Fraction of correctly disambiguated named entities in the full corpus.
* Macro-Precision: Fraction of correctly disambiguated named entities, averaged by document.

## Datasets

### AIDA CoNLL-YAGO Dataset

The [AIDA CoNLL-YAGO](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/databases-and-information-systems/research/yago-naga/aida/downloads/) Dataset [1] contains assignments of entities to the mentions of named entities annotated for the original [CoNLL 2003 NER task](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W03-0419.pdf) [2]. The entities are identified by [YAGO2](http://yago-knowledge.org/) entity identifier, by [Wikipedia URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/), or by [Freebase mid](http://wiki.freebase.com/wiki/Machine_ID).
