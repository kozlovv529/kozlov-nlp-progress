## Language modeling

Language modeling is the task of predicting the next word in a document. * indicates models using dynamic evaluation.

### Penn Treebank&mdash;language modeling

A common evaluation dataset for language modeling ist the Penn Treebank,
as pre-processed by [Mikolov et al. (2010)](http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/research/groups/speech/publi/2010/mikolov_interspeech2010_IS100722.pdf).
The dataset consists of 929k training words, 73k validation words, and
82k test words. As part of the pre-processing, words were lower-cased, numbers
were replaced with N, newlines were replaced with <eos>,
and all other punctuation was removed. The vocabulary is
the most frequent 10k words with the rest of the tokens replaced by an <unk> token.
Models are evaluated based on perplexity, which is the average
per-word log-probability (lower is better).

### WikiText-2

[WikiText-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07843) has been proposed as a more realistic
benchmark for language modeling than the pre-processed Penn Treebank. WikiText-2
consists of around 2 million words extracted from Wikipedia articles.
