# Relationship Extraction

Relationship extraction is the task of extracting semantic relationships from a text. Extracted relationships usually
occur between two or more entities of a certain type (e.g. Person, Organisation, Location) and fall into a number of
semantic categories (e.g. married to, employed by, lives in).

### New York Times Corpus

The standard corpus for distantly supervised relationship extraction is the New York Times (NYT) corpus, published in
[Riedel et al, 2010](http://www.riedelcastro.org//publications/papers/riedel10modeling.pdf).

This contains text from the [New York Times Annotated Corpus](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/ldc2008t19) with named
entities extracted from the text using the Stanford NER system and automatically linked to entities in the Freebase
knowledge base. Pairs of named entities are labelled with relationship types by aligning them against facts in the
Freebase knowledge base. (The process of using a separate database to provide label is known as 'distant supervision')

Example:
 > **Elevation Partners**, the $1.9 billion private equity group that was founded by **Roger McNamee**

 `(founded_by, Elevation_Partners, Roger_McNamee)`

Different papers have reported various metrics since the release of the dataset, making it difficult to compare systems
directly. The main metrics used are either precision at N results or plots of the precision-recall. The range of recall
has increased over the years as systems improve, with earlier systems having very low precision at 30% recall.
