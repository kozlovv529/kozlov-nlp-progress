# Summarization

Summarization is the task of producing a shorter version of a document that preserves most of the
original document's meaning.

### CNN / Daily Mail

The [CNN / Daily Mail dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03340) as processed by 
[Nallapati et al. (2016)](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/K16-1028) has been used
for evaluating summarization. The dataset contains online news articles (781 tokens 
on average) paired with multi-sentence summaries (3.75 sentences or 56 tokens on average).
The processed version contains 287,226 training pairs, 13,368 validation pairs and 11,490 test pairs.
Models are evaluated based on ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, and METEOR (optional). * indicates that models
were trained and evaluated on the anonymized version of the dataset.

## Sentence Compression

Sentence compression produces a shorter sentence by removing redundant information,
preserving the grammatically and the important content of the original sentence. 

### Google Dataset

The [Google Dataset](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/sentence-compression) was built by Filippova et al., 2013([Overcoming the Lack of Parallel Data in Sentence Compression](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D/D13/D13-1155.pdf)). The first dataset released contained only 10,000 sentence-compression pairs, but last year was released an additional 200,000 pairs. 

Example of a sentence-compression pair:
> Sentence: Floyd Mayweather is open to fighting Amir Khan in the future, despite snubbing the Bolton-born boxer in favour of a May bout with Argentine Marcos Maidana, according to promoters Golden Boy

> Compression: Floyd Mayweather is open to fighting Amir Khan in the future. 

In short, this is a deletion-based task where the compression is a subsequence from the original sentence. From the 10,000 pairs of the eval portion([repository](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/sentence-compression/tree/master/data)) it is used the very first 1,000 sentence for automatic evaluation and the 200,000 pairs for training.

Models are evaluated using the following metrics:
* F1 - compute the recall and precision in terms of tokens kept in the golden and the generated compressions.
* Compression rate (CR) - the length of the compression in characters divided over the sentence length.
